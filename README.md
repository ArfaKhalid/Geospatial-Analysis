# Geospatial-Analysis
Geospatial analysis is like playing detective with maps and data. It's about digging into information tied to specific places on Earth to uncover hidden stories and connections. Picture it as solving puzzles where the pieces are locations, satellite images, and GPS data. This kind of analysis helps in various fields, from city planning to environmental protection, make smarter decisions. It's like having a secret tool to understand how geography influences different situations. So, geospatial analysis isn't just about maps; it's a way to decode the secrets hidden in the landscapes around us.
